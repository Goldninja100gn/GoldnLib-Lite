################### Above this line is the copy-pasta ###################
#									#
#	Unfortunely MCreator doesn't allow for custom fabric.mod.json	#
#									#
#	Which means stuff for ModMenu and other modified sections 	#
#	won't stay synced when using MCreator. Plus if the file does	#
#	get modified, it won't allow syncing with MCreator.		#
#									#
#	If you help with this mod, you are allowed to add yourself to	#
#	the contributors section above.					#
#									#
#	When the mod gets compiled/exported to jar, this file can be	#
#	manually updated using WinRAR. It allows us to open .jar 	#
#	which means we can replace the code in the fabric.mod.json	#
#	file with the code above.					#
